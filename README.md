# 421-Lab-README

Here is where you can see the lab notes for Luciana Etcheverry's Econometrics (EC421) for Fall 2020. We'll periodically update these over the weekend before class on Mondays/Tuesdays and/or after class. I will generally try to make these serve as a complement rather than a substitute for lab.

For those having difficulty finding their filepath: 

Mac: control+click on the file, hold down alt, and then select copy as filepath. That object should be able to go straight into an R read_csv() function. Make sure it's surrounded by either ' ' or " "

Windows: hold shift, right click, copy filepath. Paste this into read_csv(). Flip the direction of the slashes.

If you're adventurous, Grant McDermott's data science for economists is an amazing resource. It's designed for PhD students, but not those with any experience with computers. If metrics is your calling, you might enjoy looking at these.
